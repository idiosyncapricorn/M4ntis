# Mantis Toolset

# Welcome to the Mantis Toolset!

# Setup

# 1. Download the Toolset  
# The Mantis Toolset is available for download as a `.zip` file. After downloading, unzip the file to your desired directory.

# 2. Install Requirements  
# After unzipping, make sure to install all necessary packages from the `requirements.txt` file:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Dockerfile  
# While there is a `Dockerfile` included, it's not fully configured at the moment. I recommend running the toolset directly through the terminal for now.

# Features

# - Send a lot of stuff to Discord. ðŸŽ‰

# Have Fun!  
# Feel free to explore and modify the toolset as needed.
