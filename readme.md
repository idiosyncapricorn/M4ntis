# Mantis Toolset

Welcome to the Mantis Toolset!

## Setup

1. **Install Requirements**  
   Before using the toolset, make sure to install all necessary packages from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Dockerfile**  
   While there is a `Dockerfile` included, it's not fully configured at the moment. I recommend running the toolset directly through the terminal for now.

## Features

- Send a lot of stuff to Discord. ðŸŽ‰

## Have Fun!  
Feel free to explore and modify the toolset as needed.
